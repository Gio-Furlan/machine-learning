Topic: Independent and Gaussian models for neural population activity.  Goals: Build and preprocess spike-count matrices from neural recordings. Fit an independent Bernoulli model to population activity during the task. Extend to a Gaussian model capturing pairwise correlations Compare inferred coupling (precision) matrices across behavioral states
